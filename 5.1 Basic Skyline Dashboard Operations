The most significant difference between Skyline and the original Horizon dashboard is
the separation of tenant and administrator pages. The switch button is located in the top
right corner of the main page.


Click Console to go to the tenant page, or click Administrator to go to the administrator
page.
The language switcher is located in the upper right corner. You can change the language
by clicking the avatar.
