In this section, you will create ECS1 and ECS2 based on the image created in the previous
section. The requirements for the ECSs are as follows:
1. ECS1 and ECS2 use rbd-1 and rbd-2 as their backend storage, respectively.
2. The two ECSs run on different compute nodes.
3. ceph-fuse is installed in the ECSs.
Step 1 Create an ECS flavor.
On the administrator page, choose Compute > Flavor. On the displayed page, click
Create Flavor, and configure the flavor based on the following recommended values:


After setting the values, click Next: Access Type Setting, and choose Public.



Step 2 Create a network.
On the Console page, choose Network > Networks. On the displayed page, click Create
Network and set the network based on the following recommended values:

Choose Routers from the expanded menu. Click More of an existing router (if no router
is available, create a router and set the external gateway by referring to step 2 in section
4.3.1) and choose Connect Subnet. In the displayed dialog box, select the created
openeuler1 subnet.

Step 3 Create a server group.
On the Console page, choose Compute > Server Groups.

On the displayed page, click Create Server Group and set the parameters as follows:

Step 4 Apply for floating IP addresses.
ceph-fuse needs to be installed on the two ECSs, and the ECSs need to connect to the
Internet. Therefore, you need to apply for two floating IP addresses to be bound to the
ECSs in advance. The procedure is as follows:
On the Console page, choose Network > Floating IPs.


On the displayed page, click Allocate IP. In the displayed dialog box, set the parameters
as follows:


The network and subnet are the provider network created in section 4.3.
Step 5 Create the ECSs.
Create the ECSs on the Console page. Select different types for System Disk for the ECSs
to use different backend storage.

Select _DEFAULT_ for ECS1 and openeuler for ECS2.
Set the networks of both ECSs to use the previously created port.


In System Config, add the two ECSs to the openeuler server group created in step 3.

In the User Data dialog box, enter the following information to install ceph-fuse:


Click Next: Confirm Config and click OK to create the ECS.
During the ECS creation, click the ECS name to go to the ECS details page.



Click Interfaces to go to the Port Detail page. Click More in the upper right corner,
select Associate Floating IP, and bind the floating IP address created in step 4.
Note: Ensure that the floating IP address is bound before the ECS creation is complete.
Otherwise, you will miss the time to install ceph-fuse. ceph-fuse installation may take a
long time. After the ECS is created, log in and check whether the installation progress.
The following figure shows an ongoing installation.


Wait for three minutes until the installation is complete.
Question: Is the password used for ECS login the same as the password set during
ECS creation? Why or why not?
Answer: No. The default password of the image (openEuler12#$) is used for
login. According to the following logs, the password is updated to the
configured one after ceph-fuse is installed.
